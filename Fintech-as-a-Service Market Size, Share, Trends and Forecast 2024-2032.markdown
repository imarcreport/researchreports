**Factors Affecting the Growth of the Fintech-as-a-Service Industry:**

The demand for digital innovation in financial services is a pivotal
driver of the Fintech-as-a-Service industry\'s growth. Traditional
financial institutions are under pressure to adapt to changing consumer

in enabling legacy institutions to integrate advanced digital solutions
without bearing the full cost of in-house development. Moreover, the

needs, accelerating time-to-market for new products and services, and
